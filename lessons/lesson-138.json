  "title": "The Rights of Children in Islam",
  "introduction": "In Islam, children are considered precious trusts (*amanah*) from Allah. They are granted clear rights that ensure their physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. These rights start even before birth and continue as they grow into adulthood. Parents, family, and society share the responsibility to nurture, protect, educate, and guide children, helping them become righteous, confident, and contributing members of the ummah.",

      "heading": "Fundamental Rights from Birth",
      "content": "Children’s rights in Islam begin with the parents’ choice of a righteous spouse, ensuring a loving and stable environment. During pregnancy, parents should care for their health and well-being, as the mother’s care impacts the child. After birth, children have the sacred right to life — Islam strictly forbids infanticide and all forms of harm. They should be given a good name that reflects positive meanings and Islamic identity. The Prophet ﷺ said: *'You will be called on the Day of Resurrection by your names and your fathers' names, so have good names'* (Sunan Abu Dawud). They have the right to legitimate lineage, the *aqiqah* sacrifice, and customs that welcome them into the community. Parents must provide food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, and protection from neglect or abuse."

      "heading": "Educational and Spiritual Rights",
      "content": "Islam places immense emphasis on nurturing children’s faith and character. The Prophet ﷺ said: *'Every child is born upon the fitrah (natural disposition of Islam)...'* (Sahih Bukhari). This means parents must nurture the innate purity of their child’s heart through proper Islamic education. Children should be taught the Quran, how to pray, and the basic beliefs and moral values of Islam. They also have the right to secular education that equips them with useful skills for life. The Prophet ﷺ encouraged teaching practical skills like swimming, archery, and horseback riding — showing that relevant, beneficial knowledge is encouraged for both boys and girls. Parents should also teach good manners, honesty, and respect for others. Seeking education is a right and an obligation that builds strong, knowledgeable generations."

    {
      "heading": "Love, Justice, and Emotional Well-being",
      "content": "Beyond physical and educational care, children need love, compassion, and a sense of belonging. The Prophet ﷺ was a model of gentle affection — hugging, kissing, and playing with children. When someone remarked that he kissed his grandson, he replied: *'Whoever does not show mercy will not be shown mercy'* (Sahih Bukhari). Islam emphasizes justice — parents must not favor one child over another in gifts or attention. The Prophet ﷺ said: *'Fear Allah and be just among your children'* (Sahih Bukhari). Children should be protected from all forms of abuse and emotional harm. Listening to children’s thoughts, respecting their opinions, and guiding them with wisdom builds their confidence and trust. As they mature, they deserve age-appropriate freedom to make choices, so they grow into responsible, thoughtful adults who live by Islamic values."

  "conclusion": "The rights of children in Islam reflect the deep wisdom of nurturing strong families and a healthy society. By fulfilling these rights, parents honor their trust from Allah and prepare the next generation to carry Islam’s light with knowledge, compassion, and good character.",
