  "title": "Understanding Tafsir",
  "introduction": "Tafsir is the science of explaining, interpreting, and clarifying the meanings of the Quran. It helps us understand the words of Allah as they were meant to be understood, so we can apply His guidance correctly in our daily lives. Through tafsir, we discover the wisdom, context, and beautiful lessons in each verse and strengthen our connection to the Quran.",

      "heading": "Purpose of Tafsir",
      "content": "Allah revealed the Quran as a clear guidance for humanity, but some verses need explanation to understand their deeper meanings, historical background, or correct rulings. The Quran says: 'And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them...' (Quran 16:44). Tafsir clarifies words, reasons for revelation (asbab al-nuzul), and lessons we can act upon. It protects us from misinterpreting Allah’s words and helps us see how the Quran applies to different situations."

      "heading": "Types of Tafsir",
      "content": "Scholars use different authentic methods to explain the Quran:    - **Tafsir by the Quran itself:** One verse explains another (e.g., general words clarified elsewhere).    - **Tafsir by Hadith:** The Prophet ﷺ explained many verses with his words and actions.    - **Tafsir by statements of the companions:** Companions like Ibn Abbas (RA) understood the Quran best because they learned directly from the Prophet ﷺ.    - **Tafsir by language and reasoning:** Scholars study the Arabic language, grammar, and context to explain verses correctly. Reliable tafsir books include works like Tafsir Ibn Kathir and Tafsir al-Tabari."

      "heading": "How to Study Tafsir",
      "content": "When studying tafsir, use trusted sources and check explanations from well-known scholars. Always start with the Quran and Sunnah first, then the understanding of the companions. Seek guidance from qualified teachers if you’re unsure. Reading tafsir in your own language helps deepen understanding, but be mindful of unverified translations or opinions. Finally, reflect on what you learn: ask how you can apply the lessons in your life. Allah says about the Quran: 'It is He who has sent down to you the Book; in it are verses that are clear... and others that are not entirely clear.' (Quran 3:7). This reminds us that knowledge and reflection go hand in hand."

  "conclusion": "Studying tafsir helps us read the Quran not just with our eyes, but with our hearts. It deepens our understanding, protects us from misunderstandings, and brings us closer to living by Allah’s words. May Allah grant us knowledge that benefits and hearts that reflect on His guidance.",
