      "content": "The Prophet ﷺ was born in the blessed city of Makkah in the Year of the Elephant (570 CE) into the noble tribe of Quraysh. He lost his father before birth and his mother, Amina, when he was six years old, becoming an orphan at a young age. He was then cared for by his grandfather, Abdul Muttalib, and later his uncle, Abu Talib. From his youth, he was known among the Makkans as 'Al-Amin' (the Trustworthy) and 'As-Sadiq' (the Truthful) due to his honesty, integrity, and kind nature. He worked as a shepherd and later as a merchant, gaining a reputation for fair dealings. His marriage to Khadijah (RA), a noble and wise businesswoman, provided him with love and support during his early mission."

      "heading": "Prophethood and Mission",
      "content": "At the age of 40, while meditating in the Cave of Hira, the Prophet ﷺ received the first revelation through Angel Jibreel (Gabriel). This marked the beginning of his mission to call people to Tawhid (Oneness of Allah) and righteousness. Despite facing severe persecution, insults, and physical harm from the Quraysh, he remained steadfast and patient. He preached with wisdom, compassion, and perseverance, gradually winning the hearts of people from different backgrounds. Important milestones of his mission include the migration (Hijrah) to Madinah, where he established the first Islamic state based on justice and mutual support. There, he acted as a spiritual leader, statesman, judge, and military commander — always upholding mercy and fairness, even towards his enemies. His Farewell Sermon emphasized equality, human rights, and the importance of adhering to the Quran and his Sunnah."
