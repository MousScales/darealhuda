  "title": "The Role of Sunnah",
  "introduction": "The Sunnah is the way, teachings, and example of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. It explains the Quran, shows us how to put Allah’s words into practice, and guides us in every aspect of life — from acts of worship to daily manners and relationships. Following the Sunnah helps us live in a way that pleases Allah and brings blessings into our lives.",

      "heading": "Definition of Sunnah",
      "content": "The Sunnah includes the Prophet’s ﷺ sayings (his words), actions (his deeds), and approvals (things he witnessed and did not forbid). These were carefully recorded by the companions and later scholars through authentic hadith collections. Allah says: *'And whatever the Messenger has given you — take; and what he has forbidden you — refrain from.'* (Quran 59:7). The Sunnah explains the Quran’s teachings in practical ways — like how to pray, fast, give zakat, and live with good character."

      "heading": "Importance of Following Sunnah",
      "content": "Following the Sunnah perfects our practice of Islam and protects us from mistakes or innovations. The Prophet ﷺ was the best example of how to live a balanced, righteous life: *'Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example…'* (Quran 33:21). Loving and following his way brings us closer to Allah’s love and mercy. The Prophet ﷺ said: *'Whoever obeys me has obeyed Allah.'* (Sahih Bukhari 7288). Through the Sunnah, we connect our everyday actions — like eating, greeting, or sleeping — to acts of worship."

      "heading": "How to Follow the Sunnah",
      "content": "To follow the Sunnah, we should learn about the Prophet’s ﷺ life, his character, and how he worshipped and treated people. Read authentic hadith books, seerah (biography), and attend reliable classes or study circles. Start by practicing his daily habits: saying *Bismillah*, eating with the right hand, greeting others with *Salam*, praying Sunnah prayers, and using kind speech. Love what he loved, stay away from what he disliked, and make dua to be among those closest to him on the Day of Judgment."
