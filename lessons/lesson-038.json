  "title": "Islam and Mental Health",
  "introduction": "Islam recognizes the importance of caring for the mind, heart, and emotions. Just as we care for our physical health, our mental and emotional wellbeing is also part of our trust (amanah) from Allah. Islam teaches us to seek balance, comfort, and support through faith, community, and healthy coping strategies. Asking for help and practicing self-care are encouraged and never a sign of weak faith.",

      "heading": "Spiritual Support",
      "content": "Prayer, dhikr, and trust in Allah bring comfort, strength, and hope during difficult times. Allah reminds us: 'Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.' (Quran 13:28). Making dua, reciting the Quran, and reflecting on Allah’s mercy help calm the heart and ease worries. The Prophet ﷺ himself faced moments of deep sadness, yet he turned to Allah with patience and hope. Islam teaches us that tests and hardship are part of life — but they are never without purpose or reward."

      "heading": "Seeking Help",
      "content": "Seeking help when we are struggling is not a weakness, but an act of courage and self-care. The Prophet ﷺ said: 'Make use of medical treatment...' (Sahih Bukhari 564), which includes seeking professional support for mental health. Talking to trusted family and friends, scholars, or mental health professionals can bring relief and guidance. Taking practical steps like rest, healthy habits, and stress management are part of relying on Allah while using the means He has provided."

      "heading": "Community and Compassion",
      "content": "A supportive community can ease the burden of emotional struggles. Islam calls us to show compassion and kindness to those who are hurting and never judge or shame them. Avoid stigma or gossip — instead, be someone who listens without harshness and reminds others of hope. The Prophet ﷺ said: 'The believers, in their mutual kindness, compassion and sympathy, are just like one body.' (Sahih Muslim). A caring word, a visit, or simply being present can make a huge difference for someone going through a hard time."

  "conclusion": "Taking care of your mind and heart is part of taking care of your faith. Trust Allah, seek help when needed, and be gentle with yourself and others. May Allah grant us strength, peace, and healing in all difficulties.",
