  "introduction": "Prophet Sulayman (Solomon) ﷺ was a remarkable prophet and king blessed by Allah with wisdom, justice, and unique miracles. He ruled a vast kingdom, commanded the wind and the jinn, and could understand the speech of animals. Yet despite his great power, he remained humble and always thanked Allah for His favors. Sulayman’s story inspires us to use our gifts with gratitude, fairness, and faith.",

      "content": "Allah granted Sulayman (AS) many special gifts. He could understand the speech of birds, ants, and other creatures. The Quran beautifully tells how he heard an ant warn its colony to move away from his army: *'So he smiled, amused at her speech, and said: My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor…'* (Quran 27:19). Allah also gave him control over the wind, which carried him swiftly to distant lands, and power over the jinn, who worked for him and built magnificent structures. Despite these wonders, he always remembered that these gifts were from Allah alone."

      "content": "Prophet Sulayman (AS) was known for his fair and wise judgments. One famous story in the Quran tells of two women who came to him with a dispute over a baby. With wisdom and insight, he resolved the matter justly (Quran 21:78-79). He ruled his people with compassion and upheld the rights of all, rich or poor. He made dua to Allah for a kingdom that would be a means of good, not arrogance: *'My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor… and admit me by Your mercy into [the ranks of] Your righteous servants.'* (Quran 27:19)."
