        "content": "Prophet Ayyub (AS) was blessed with health, wealth, family, and status. But Allah tested him by taking away everything: his health deteriorated with painful illness, his wealth was lost, and his family passed away except for his loyal wife. Despite his suffering, he never complained or lost faith. He continued to praise and remember Allah, saying: *'Indeed, adversity has touched me, and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.'* (Quran 21:83). His unwavering patience shows the highest level of trust in Allah’s wisdom."

        "content": "When Ayyub (AS) turned to Allah with sincere dua, Allah answered his call. Allah commanded him to strike the ground with his foot, and a spring of water gushed forth, curing his illness. Allah restored his health, wealth, and blessed him with a new family. *'So We responded to him and removed what afflicted him of adversity. And We gave him [back] his family and the like thereof with them as mercy from Us…'* (Quran 21:84). His relief reminds us that no hardship lasts forever when we turn to Allah with hope and patience."

        "content": "Ayyub’s story teaches us that true faith means staying patient during tests and grateful during ease. Hardships are not punishments but can be a way for our sins to be forgiven and our ranks to be raised. He never blamed Allah or complained — instead, he made dua with humility. His wife’s loyalty and support also remind us of the blessing of family who stand by us in difficult times. We should remember Ayyub’s example whenever we face struggles and trust in Allah’s wisdom and mercy."
