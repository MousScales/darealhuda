      "content": "The Battle of Badr took place in the second year after the Hijrah (624 CE), near the wells of Badr, about 80 miles southwest of Madinah. The Prophet ﷺ and about 313 Muslims set out to intercept a Quraysh trade caravan led by Abu Sufyan, hoping to weaken the Makkans economically. However, the caravan managed to escape, and instead, the Muslims found themselves facing a fully prepared Makkan army of nearly 1,000 warriors, led by some of Islam’s fiercest enemies. The Muslims had only two horses, about 70 camels, and very few weapons compared to the Quraysh army’s 100 horses and 700 camels. Despite these odds, the Prophet ﷺ consulted his companions. The Muhajireen and the Ansar pledged their support with words of unwavering faith, and together they chose to stand firm and trust in Allah’s promise of victory."

      "content": "The battle began with traditional single combat. Ali ibn Abi Talib (RA), Hamza ibn Abdul Muttalib (RA), and Ubaydah ibn al-Harith (RA) stepped forward to face Quraysh champions and defeated them. As the fighting intensified, the Prophet ﷺ supplicated earnestly: *'O Allah! Should this small band perish today, You will not be worshipped on this earth.'* (Sahih Muslim). Allah responded to his sincere plea by sending thousands of angels to support the believers, as mentioned in the Quran: *'Indeed, Allah helped you at Badr when you were few in number.'* (Quran 3:123). The Muslim army fought with remarkable courage and unity, while the angels joined them in unseen ways. Seventy Quraysh fighters were killed, including Abu Jahl, one of the Prophet’s greatest enemies. Another seventy were captured. The Muslims lost only fourteen brave souls as martyrs, a testament to Allah’s divine help and the power of sincere faith."

      "content": "The Battle of Badr holds enormous significance in Islamic history. It was called *Yawm al-Furqan* — the Day of Criterion — because it clearly distinguished truth from falsehood. The victory boosted the morale of the Muslims and established their strength and credibility in Arabia. It showed that victory does not depend on numbers or resources but on faith, unity, and reliance on Allah. After the battle, the Prophet ﷺ treated the prisoners of war with compassion and wisdom, offering them freedom in exchange for teaching literacy skills to Muslim children. This highlighted Islam’s values of mercy and the importance of knowledge. The Battle of Badr reminds us that when we put our trust in Allah, strive sincerely, and remain united, we can overcome even the greatest obstacles, no matter how impossible they seem."
