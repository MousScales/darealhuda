      "heading": "Spiritual Diseases",
      "content": "Just as the body can become sick, the heart can suffer from spiritual diseases that darken it and distance us from Allah. These include jealousy — wanting others’ blessings to be taken away, pride — feeling better than others, anger — when uncontrolled, it leads to hurtful words and actions, and hypocrisy — saying one thing while hiding disbelief or insincerity. These traits eat away at good deeds and prevent true peace of mind. Recognizing these flaws in ourselves is the first step to healing."

      "heading": "How to Purify the Heart",
      "content": "Purifying the heart requires daily effort and sincerity. Start by repenting to Allah often, asking Him to forgive your mistakes and cleanse your heart. Remember Allah frequently (dhikr), recite Quran, and make heartfelt dua. Seek beneficial knowledge that softens the heart and increases humility. Keep good company — surround yourself with people who remind you of Allah and inspire you to be better. Practice good character traits like gratitude, patience, and forgiveness, which push out harmful qualities from the heart. Reflect on your intentions often and ask Allah for a heart that is truthful and sound."

      "heading": "Benefits of a Pure Heart",
      "content": "A pure heart brings countless blessings. It makes worship sincere and meaningful. It brings inner peace and protects you from envy, grudges, and restlessness. A pure heart makes you more forgiving and loving towards others. Most importantly, Allah promises that true success on the Day of Judgment will be for those who come to Him with a sound heart — free from pride, hatred, and disbelief. This is the greatest reward: closeness to Allah and peace in this life and the next."
