      "content": "As a young boy, Yusuf (AS) saw a dream foretelling his future status, which he shared with his father, Prophet Yaqub (AS). Out of jealousy, his brothers betrayed him, threw him into a well, and lied to their father. Yusuf was found and sold into slavery in Egypt, where he grew up in the house of a nobleman. Despite his honesty and good character, he faced another trial when he was falsely accused and unjustly imprisoned. Yet in each hardship, he remained patient and trusted Allah’s wisdom, never letting bitterness take root in his heart."

      "content": "Allah granted Yusuf (AS) wisdom, the ability to interpret dreams, and a pure, upright character. While in prison, he used this gift to help his fellow prisoners and eventually interpreted the king’s troubling dream, which foretold years of famine. Through Allah’s plan, Yusuf was released with his innocence proven and rose to a position of great authority in Egypt, managing the storehouses and saving the nation from starvation. In this position, he was reunited with his family in a beautiful ending that brought healing, forgiveness, and honor."
