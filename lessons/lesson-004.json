  "introduction": "Allah, in His infinite wisdom and mercy, sent down scriptures to guide humanity through every era. These divine books contain light, guidance, and laws that called people to truth and righteousness. Belief in these scriptures is one of the six pillars of Iman (faith) and reflects our conviction that Allah has never left humanity without guidance. Understanding the divine books helps us appreciate the continuity of divine revelation and the unique status of the Quran.",

      "content": "Allah revealed scriptures to several of His messengers to convey His guidance and laws. The major books mentioned in the Quran are:\n\n1. **The Torah (Tawrat)**: Revealed to Prophet Musa (Moses, peace be upon him). It contained guidance and laws for the Children of Israel. It emphasized justice, worship, and morality.\n\n2. **The Psalms (Zabur)**: Revealed to Prophet Dawud (David, peace be upon him). It consisted mainly of praises, supplications, and wisdom, focusing on spiritual devotion.\n\n3. **The Gospel (Injeel)**: Revealed to Prophet Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him). It called for love, mercy, and devotion to Allah, reaffirming the message of previous scriptures.\n\n4. **The Quran**: Revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. It is the final and most complete revelation, preserved in its original form.\n\nOther scriptures, such as the **Scrolls (Suhuf)** of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (in a different form than the Torah), are also alluded to in the Quran (87:18-19).\n\nIt’s important to note that while we affirm belief in all the original revelations, the versions available today of the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel have been altered over time. The Quran is the only divine book preserved in its exact revealed form."

      "heading": "The Quran: The Final Revelation",
      "content": "The Quran is Allah’s final message to humanity. It is a miracle in language, content, and impact. Unlike previous scriptures, which were sent to specific peoples and time periods, the Quran is universal and timeless.\n\n- **Perfectly Preserved**: Allah promised to protect it: *“Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur’an and indeed, We will be its guardian.”* (Quran 15:9)\n\n- **Comprehensive and Final**: It confirms the truths in previous scriptures while correcting distortions that had crept in. It is a complete guide for belief, worship, law, and ethics.\n\n- **Inimitable**: The Quran challenged humanity to produce even a single surah like it — a challenge that remains unmet to this day.\n\n- **Living Guidance**: It speaks directly to the heart, mind, and soul of the believer. Every verse holds relevance for all times, places, and people.\n\n- **Used in Worship**: Reciting the Quran is an act of worship. It is recited in every prayer, memorized by millions, and studied in depth for personal growth and legal rulings."

      "heading": "Why Believe in the Books?",
      "content": "Belief in the divine books teaches us several crucial lessons and values:\n\n1. **Affirms Allah’s Mercy and Justice**: Allah never left people without guidance. Through every age, He sent revelation to correct, reform, and uplift societies.\n\n2. **Builds Respect for All Prophets**: Recognizing the divine books connects us with the long line of messengers, creating unity among believers.\n\n3. **Highlights the Continuity of Revelation**: Islam is not a new religion, but a continuation and completion of earlier divine messages. Believing in the books acknowledges the shared spiritual heritage of all Abrahamic faiths.\n\n4. **Inspires Gratitude and Responsibility**: We are honored to have the Quran — the final, complete, and protected message. It is both a blessing and a trust we must uphold.\n\n5. **Reinforces Faith in the Unseen**: Even if the original texts of previous books are lost or changed, our belief in them as they were originally revealed strengthens our faith in Allah’s plan."

      "heading": "Our Relationship with the Quran Today",
      "content": "As Muslims, our connection to the Quran should be central to our lives. Belief alone is not enough — we must also:\n\n- **Read it regularly**, with understanding and reflection.\n- **Implement its teachings** in our character, worship, family life, and community.\n- **Seek knowledge** of tafsir (exegesis) to deeply understand the wisdom behind the verses.\n- **Teach it to others** and pass on its message to the next generation.\n- **Turn to it for guidance** in times of confusion, sorrow, or decision-making.\n\nThe Quran is not just a book to be recited — it is a living guide that transforms lives and communities when applied with sincerity."

  "conclusion": "Belief in the divine books connects us to the long history of divine guidance sent by Allah to humanity.
