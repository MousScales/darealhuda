  "title": "The Etiquette of Islamic Gatherings",
  "introduction": "Islam provides beautiful guidance on how to behave in gatherings, whether at home, in the mosque, or at community events. Good manners (*adab*) in gatherings help protect hearts, maintain respect among people, and create an atmosphere of blessing (*barakah*). By following these etiquettes, Muslims uphold the dignity of others, strengthen ties of brotherhood and sisterhood, and earn Allah’s pleasure through actions that seem small but carry great reward.",

      "heading": "Entering and Greeting",
      "content": "Etiquette begins even before you step inside. Allah says: *“O you who believe! Do not enter houses other than your own until you have asked permission and greeted their inhabitants.”* (Quran 24:27). Seeking permission respects others’ privacy and creates trust. Enter with *Bismillah* and the greeting of peace: *“As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.”* The Prophet ﷺ said: *“When you enter a house, greet with salaam, for it will be a blessing for you and the inhabitants of the house.”* (Tirmidhi). Remove shoes if customary, dress modestly, and avoid bringing anything that may cause discomfort to the hosts or guests. If seating is arranged, accept where you are placed without competing for the best spot. The Prophet ﷺ said: *“Do not reserve a place for yourself nor sit in the place of someone else.”* This teaches humility and consideration for others."

      "heading": "Participating in Conversations",
      "content": "Conversations in gatherings should reflect Islamic manners: gentle, truthful, and beneficial. Allah advises: *“And lower your voice; indeed, the most disagreeable of sounds is the voice of donkeys.”* (Quran 31:19). Speak clearly but kindly, avoid interrupting, and listen with respect. The Prophet ﷺ said: *“Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should speak good or remain silent.”* (Sahih Bukhari) This means we should not waste words on gossip, backbiting, or mockery. Avoid bringing up topics that may spark unnecessary arguments. Instead, use the opportunity to remind each other of good, share beneficial knowledge, and make others feel included and valued. Smiling and showing warmth are sunnah too — they open hearts and strengthen the bond between people."

      "heading": "Proper Conduct and Departure",
      "content": "Throughout the gathering, be mindful of everyone’s comfort. Share space, avoid overcrowding, and help with serving food or tidying up if appropriate. When food is served, remember the Prophet’s ﷺ sunnah: begin with *Bismillah*, eat with the right hand, and express thanks to Allah at the end. If a mistake happens — such as an unkind word — the Prophet ﷺ taught us to say the gathering expiation *dua*: *“Subhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdika, ash-hadu alla ilaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atubu ilayka.”* (Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise be to You. I bear witness there is no god but You. I seek Your forgiveness and turn to You). (Sahih Muslim) Leave at a respectful time without overstaying, thank your host sincerely, and make *dua* for their home and family. Small acts of courtesy can plant seeds of love and strengthen the community."

  "conclusion": "Islamic etiquette in gatherings transforms ordinary moments into acts of worship. By entering with permission, greeting with peace, speaking kindly, and parting with gratitude, we reflect the beautiful manners of our Prophet ﷺ and help build gatherings that are filled with blessings, mutual respect, and sincere love for the sake of Allah.",
