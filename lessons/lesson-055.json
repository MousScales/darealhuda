  "title": "Rights of Neighbors",
  "introduction": "Islam teaches us to treat our neighbors with kindness and respect, no matter their faith or background. Good treatment of neighbors is part of perfecting our faith and building peaceful, caring communities. The Prophet ﷺ reminded us that neglecting or harming our neighbors is a serious matter in Islam.",

    {
      "heading": "Good Treatment",
      "content": "Allah commands: *'Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good, and to relatives, orphans, the needy, the near neighbor, the neighbor farther away…'* (Quran 4:36). Greet your neighbors with warmth and kindness. Share food with them, especially during times of joy or hardship. The Prophet ﷺ said: *'He is not a believer whose stomach is filled while his neighbor goes hungry.'* (Sahih Bukhari). Offer help when they need it — whether that’s carrying groceries, watching over their house, or comforting them during illness or loss."

    {
      "heading": "Avoiding Harm",
      "content": "Being a good neighbor also means protecting them from any harm. The Prophet ﷺ warned: *'By Allah, he does not believe… whose neighbor is not safe from his harm.'* (Sahih Bukhari 6014). Never disturb your neighbors with loud noise, arguments, or disrespectful behavior. Respect their privacy, property, and personal space. Avoid parking in ways that block their driveways or creating problems for them. Small acts of consideration build trust and kindness."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Building Community",
      "content": "Strong neighborly ties help create safe, supportive communities. Islam encourages visiting one another, exchanging gifts, and showing concern for each other’s wellbeing. Checking on your neighbors, especially the elderly or those living alone, is a form of caring for the wider community. The Prophet ﷺ received so many reminders from Jibreel (AS) about neighbors that he said: *'I thought he would make them heirs.'* (Sahih Muslim 2625). This shows how high their rights are in Islam."

  "conclusion": "Caring for neighbors is a sign of true faith and brings Allah’s blessings to our homes and communities. By following the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah, we can be neighbors who spread kindness, mercy, and support wherever we live.",
