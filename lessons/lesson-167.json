  "introduction": "Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Power or Night of Decree, is the most blessed night of the year when the Quran was first revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This magnificent night, hidden within the last ten nights of Ramadan, is described in the Quran as being *“better than a thousand months.”* Understanding its significance and knowing how to seek it can transform our spiritual lives, bringing immense reward, forgiveness, and Allah’s special mercy.",

      "heading": "The Significance and Virtues of Laylat al-Qadr",
      "content": "Allah dedicated an entire chapter of the Quran to this night: *“Indeed, We sent the Quran down during the Night of Decree. And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months.”* (Quran 97:1–3). This means that worship performed on this single night carries the reward of worshipping for more than 83 years — a gift from Allah’s immense mercy. The Prophet ﷺ said: *“Whoever establishes the prayers on the night of Qadr out of sincere faith and hoping to attain Allah’s rewards, then all his past sins will be forgiven.”* (Sahih Bukhari). On this night, the angels descend in great numbers, bringing peace until the break of dawn. It is also when Allah’s decrees for the coming year are finalized, making it a powerful time for sincere dua. The exact date is hidden to encourage believers to strive throughout the last ten nights, increasing devotion and worship."

      "heading": "Signs and Timing of Laylat al-Qadr",
      "content": "While its exact timing is concealed, the Prophet ﷺ taught us how to seek it: *“Search for the Night of Qadr in the odd nights of the last ten nights of Ramadan.”* (Sahih Bukhari). Some narrations point to the 27th night, but scholars agree it may be any of the last ten nights, encouraging effort throughout. The Prophet ﷺ described signs that may appear: the night is calm, neither hot nor cold; the moon appears clear like a plate; and the next morning the sun rises softly without harsh rays. However, these signs may not be obvious every year, and the focus should be on sincere worship rather than waiting for signs. This hidden timing keeps believers striving every Ramadan, seeking this night with renewed hope."

      "heading": "How to Seek and Worship on Laylat al-Qadr",
      "content": "The best way to seek Laylat al-Qadr is to increase your worship and devotion during all the last ten nights. The Prophet ﷺ would exert himself more in worship during these nights than at any other time. Recite the Quran with reflection, stand in extra night prayers (*qiyam al-layl*), engage in abundant dhikr and istighfar, and make heartfelt dua. Aisha (RA) asked the Prophet ﷺ what to say if she recognized Laylat al-Qadr, and he taught her: *“Allahumma innaka afuwwun tuhibbul afwa fa’fu anni”* (O Allah, You are Pardoning and You love to pardon, so pardon me) — (Sunan al-Tirmidhi). This short, beautiful supplication highlights seeking Allah’s forgiveness and mercy. Increase charity, as the Prophet ﷺ was most generous during Ramadan. Use these nights to ask Allah for your needs, for forgiveness for yourself and others, and for relief and guidance for the entire ummah. The key is sincerity, humility, and persistence in worship, trusting in Allah’s promise."

  "conclusion": "Laylat al-Qadr is Allah’s precious gift to the Muslim ummah, offering a lifetime of reward in a single night. By striving to seek it during the last ten nights through prayer, Quran, remembrance, and heartfelt dua, believers can draw closer to Allah’s mercy, forgiveness, and love — and transform their hearts for the year to come.",
