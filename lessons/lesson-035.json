  "title": "Islamic Business Ethics",
  "introduction": "Islam teaches us that honesty, fairness, and responsibility must be at the heart of all business dealings. A Muslim’s earning should be pure and lawful (halal), because every transaction is not just a trade between people, but an act that will be accounted for before Allah. Good business ethics strengthen trust in the community and bring blessings in this life and the next.",

      "heading": "Principles of Business",
      "content": "Islamic business principles are built on honesty, transparency, and justice. Trade and business transactions should be free from cheating, fraud, deception, and unfair practices. Islam strictly prohibits riba (interest), which leads to exploitation and injustice in society. We are also warned against hoarding, price manipulation, and false advertising. The Prophet ﷺ said, 'The honest and trustworthy merchant will be with the Prophets, the truthful, and the martyrs on the Day of Judgment.' This shows the high status given to fair business conduct."

    {
      "heading": "Rights of Workers and Customers",
      "content": "Islam emphasizes the rights of everyone involved in a transaction. Employers must pay workers fair wages on time and treat them with respect and kindness. The Prophet ﷺ said, 'Give the worker his wages before his sweat dries.' Contracts and promises must be honored, and customers must be treated fairly and honestly. Cheating with weights and measures is strictly forbidden, as it destroys trust and invites Allah’s displeasure. Every Muslim should deal with people in business as they would like to be treated themselves."

      "heading": "Blessings of Halal Earnings",
      "content": "Earning halal income brings immense blessings. It feeds your family with pure sustenance, protects your wealth from harm, and makes your du’as more likely to be accepted. The Prophet ﷺ taught that Allah is pure and only accepts what is pure. Even small, lawful earnings are better than large amounts gained through unlawful means. A halal income purifies the heart, removes greed, and brings true contentment and barakah (blessings) in life."
    }
  ],
  "conclusion": "Practicing good business ethics is a sign of sincere faith and strong character. It builds trust, strengthens the community, and brings blessings from Allah. May we always earn and spend our wealth in ways that please Him and lead to success in this life and the Hereafter.",
