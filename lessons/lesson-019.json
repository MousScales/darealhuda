It allows us to access Islamic knowledge from scholars around the world, read the Quran, listen to lectures, and learn about our faith more easily than ever.

      "heading": "Risks and Dangers",
      "content": "The digital world has many hidden risks. Excessive screen time can distract us from prayer, family, and real-life responsibilities. Social media can lead to envy, backbiting, and unhealthy comparisons when we constantly look at others’ lives. It’s easy to become addicted to scrolling, wasting hours that could be spent in worship or meaningful activities. Exposure to inappropriate or harmful content can weaken our faith and hearts. That’s why it’s so important to set boundaries — protect your time, use filters, unfollow negative influences, and take regular breaks to reconnect with the real world."

      "heading": "Islamic Guidelines",
      "content": "Islam teaches us to use every tool in a way that pleases Allah. Use technology for good — seek knowledge, benefit others, and spread positivity. Avoid gossip, backbiting, or sharing private matters that can harm others. Be mindful of what you post and consume: guard your eyes and your tongue, and remember that modesty applies online too. Maintain privacy for yourself and your family, and do not expose others’ faults. Always ask yourself before posting or watching: Would this please Allah? Remember that every word and click is recorded."

  "conclusion": "A balanced digital life means protecting your time and heart. Use technology as a tool to benefit your faith, but never let it distract you from real-world worship, family ties, and community connection. May Allah help us use our screens for good and protect us from their harms.",
