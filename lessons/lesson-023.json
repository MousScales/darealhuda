      "content": "Musa (AS) was born at a time when Pharaoh was killing the sons of the Children of Israel out of fear of losing power. By Allah’s plan, Musa was saved as a baby and raised in Pharaoh’s own palace, cared for by his own mother through Allah’s mercy. When Musa grew up, he accidentally killed a man while trying to stop a fight and fled to Madyan. There, he lived humbly, married, and worked until Allah called him to prophethood. At the burning bush, Allah spoke to Musa directly, commanding him to go back to Pharaoh and deliver His message of Tawheed — worshiping Allah alone."

      "heading": "Confrontation with Pharaoh",
      "content": "Musa (AS) bravely faced Pharaoh, one of the most powerful tyrants in history, calling him to abandon his arrogance and submit to Allah. Allah gave Musa miracles — his staff turning into a serpent, his hand shining with light, and many signs that proved the truth. Despite Pharaoh’s threats and the magicians’ tricks, Musa stood firm, and the magicians themselves recognized the truth and believed. When Pharaoh’s cruelty worsened, Allah commanded Musa to lead the Children of Israel out of Egypt. At the Red Sea, when they were trapped, Musa trusted Allah completely. By Allah’s command, he struck the sea with his staff, and it split into paths, allowing his people to escape while Pharaoh and his army drowned. This victory showed that Allah always protects those who rely on Him."

      "heading": "Lessons from Musa's Story",
      "content": "Prophet Musa’s story teaches us many timeless lessons. It reminds us to trust Allah fully, even when the situation seems hopeless. We learn to stand up for justice and speak the truth fearlessly, like Musa did before Pharaoh. His story also shows the importance of patience with our own people — Musa remained patient with the Children of Israel despite their complaints and disobedience. His dua for strength, guidance, and calmness shows us how to seek Allah’s help when we feel overwhelmed. Like Musa, we should always keep our faith strong and never lose hope in Allah’s mercy."
