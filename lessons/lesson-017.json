      "content": "The main purpose of marriage in Islam is to find peace, comfort, and companionship in one another. Allah says He created spouses for us so that we may find tranquility in them, and He placed love and mercy between our hearts. Marriage helps us grow emotionally, spiritually, and even financially when we support one another. It is also a way to build a righteous family and raise children in an environment of faith, respect, and good character. When spouses work together for the sake of Allah, their marriage becomes an act of worship."

      "heading": "Rights and Duties",
      "content": "Both husband and wife have rights and responsibilities that should be fulfilled with kindness and justice. A husband should provide for his wife’s needs — financial, emotional, and physical — with respect and compassion. A wife should honor and support her husband, and both should help each other stay firm in faith. They must protect each other’s dignity and privacy, avoid hurting each other with harsh words or actions, and forgive one another’s shortcomings. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, 'The best of you are those who are best to their families.'"

      "content": "A successful marriage requires effort, patience, and sincere intention. Open and honest communication is essential — speak kindly, listen with respect, and try to understand each other’s needs. Patience helps you get through difficult times without letting small problems grow. Forgiveness is vital because no one is perfect; overlook mistakes for the sake of Allah. Always put Allah at the center of your relationship — pray together, remind each other of His guidance, and keep your home a place of faith and mercy. Small acts of kindness, gratitude, and affection go a long way in strengthening the bond."
