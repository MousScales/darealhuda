      "heading": "Description of Paradise",
      "content": "Jannah is a place of eternal peace, joy, and reward for those who believe and do righteous deeds. Allah says: *'Gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow…'* (Quran 3:136). In Paradise are things no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no heart can imagine. Its people will feel no pain, sorrow, or fear. They will be greeted with peace, dwell in beautiful homes, and enjoy pure companionship, delicious food, and every delight their souls desire. Above all, they will see their Lord and receive His pleasure forever."

      "heading": "Description of Hell",
      "content": "Jahannam is a place of punishment for those who reject faith and persist in evil. Allah describes it as a blazing fire, with boiling water, scorching winds, and bitter food. Its inhabitants will feel regret and wish to return to life to do good, but it will be too late. Allah says: *'And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups…'* (Quran 39:71). The Prophet ﷺ said the punishment is beyond anything one can bear in this life. Remembering Hell keeps our hearts humble and warns us to avoid major sins."

      "heading": "How to Attain Paradise",

The Prophet ﷺ said: *'Whoever asks Allah for Paradise three times, Paradise says: O Allah, admit him to Paradise…'* (Tirmidhi). Never lose hope in Allah’s mercy."
