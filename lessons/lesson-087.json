  "title": "Avoiding Backbiting",
  "introduction": "Backbiting (*ghibah*) means speaking about someone behind their back in a way they would dislike if they heard it — even if it is true. Islam teaches us that backbiting is a major sin that damages hearts, relationships, and entire communities. Protecting our tongue is a key part of protecting our faith.",

      "heading": "Why Backbiting is Harmful",
      "content": "Allah warns us: *'And do not backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would detest it…'* (Quran 49:12). This powerful image shows how ugly backbiting is in Allah’s sight. It destroys trust and spreads hatred and suspicion among friends, families, and communities. The Prophet ﷺ said: *'Do you know what backbiting is?' They said: 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said: 'It is to mention about your brother something he dislikes.'* (Sahih Muslim 2589). Even small careless words can leave lasting wounds."

      "heading": "How to Avoid Backbiting",
      "content": "• Think before you speak — ask yourself: 'Would I say this if they were here?'  \n• If gossip starts, change the topic or gently remind others to stop.  \n• Defend your brother or sister in their absence — the Prophet ﷺ said whoever defends another’s honor, Allah will defend them from the Fire (Tirmidhi).  \n• Keep good company — be around people who speak good and avoid gossip.  \n• Make dua that Allah purifies your tongue and heart from harmful speech."

      "heading": "Seeking Forgiveness",
      "content": "If you have backbitten someone, repent sincerely to Allah. The Prophet ﷺ taught us that true repentance means feeling regret, stopping the sin, and resolving not to repeat it. Where possible, seek forgiveness from the person you wronged — but if this might cause more harm, make dua for them and do good deeds on their behalf. Purifying our speech protects our hearts and keeps our deeds safe for the Hereafter."

  "conclusion": "Avoiding backbiting protects your heart, honors others, and strengthens love and trust in your relationships. May Allah help us guard our tongues, speak only good, and gather with people whose words bring peace and blessing.",
