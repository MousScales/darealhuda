    "introduction": "Tajweed is the science and art of reciting the Quran correctly, beautifully, and exactly as the Prophet ﷺ recited it. The word *tajweed* comes from the Arabic root meaning 'to make better or to improve.' Learning and applying tajweed preserves the Quran's pronunciation and honors the words of Allah.",

        "heading": "Purpose of Tajweed",
        "content": "The Quran was revealed in clear, precise Arabic. Tajweed ensures that each letter is pronounced from its correct place in the mouth and throat (*makhraj*) and with its proper qualities (*sifaat*). This protects the Quran from changes in meaning that can happen if letters or words are mispronounced. Allah says: 'And recite the Quran with measured recitation.' (Quran 73:4). Reciting with tajweed also brings calmness and beauty to our recitation, making it more pleasing to listen to and more rewarding for the reciter."

        "heading": "Basic Rules",
        "content": "Some basic tajweed rules include:  \n  - **Makharij al-Huruf (Articulation points):** Knowing where each letter comes from in the mouth or throat.  \n  - **Madd (Elongation):** Lengthening certain vowels for the correct amount of beats (e.g., 2, 4, or 6 counts).  \n  - **Ghunnah (Nasal sound):** A humming sound used with letters like noon (ن) and meem (م).  \n  - **Waqf (Stopping rules):** Knowing when and how to pause properly to keep the meaning clear.  \n  - **Idgham, Ikhfa, Iqlab, Izhar:** Rules for pronouncing noon saakin and tanween when they come before certain letters.  \n  These rules help make our recitation clear and in line with how the Prophet ﷺ taught his companions."

        "heading": "How to Learn Tajweed",
        "content": "Tajweed is best learned directly from a qualified teacher (*shaykh* or *ustadh*) who can correct your mistakes. Listen to skilled reciters, like those who recite in the Haram, and repeat after them. Practice slowly and carefully — consistency is key. Start with short surahs and gradually build up. Many people find it helpful to join a tajweed circle or Quran class for regular practice and encouragement. The Prophet ﷺ said: 'The best of you are those who learn the Quran and teach it.' (Sahih Bukhari 4937)."

    "conclusion": "Applying tajweed protects the Quran's beauty and meaning and brings reward from Allah. By reciting carefully and correctly, we honor the words of Allah and connect our hearts to His Book in the best way.",
