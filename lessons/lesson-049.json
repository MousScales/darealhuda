  "introduction": "Night prayer (*Tahajjud*) is one of the most beloved and rewarding acts of worship in Islam. It is a special time to connect with Allah when most people are asleep. Standing in prayer during the quiet of the night strengthens your faith, brings inner peace, and opens the doors to Allah’s mercy and forgiveness.",

      "content": "Night prayer is a sign of deep sincerity and devotion. Allah praises those who leave their beds to worship Him: 'They used to sleep but little of the night, and in the hours before dawn they would ask forgiveness.' (Quran 51:17-18). The Prophet ﷺ said: 'Our Lord descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the night remains and says: \"Who is calling upon Me, so I may respond to him? Who is asking Me, so I may give him? Who is seeking My forgiveness, so I may forgive him?\"' (Sahih Bukhari 1131). It is a time when duas are more likely to be answered and the heart finds closeness to Allah."

      "heading": "How to Perform Tahajjud",
      "content": "Tahajjud can be prayed any time after Isha prayer and before Fajr. It is best performed in the last third of the night when its reward is greatest. Pray in sets of two rak’ahs, as the Prophet ﷺ did, and you can pray as many rak’ahs as you wish. End with Witr prayer if you have not prayed it already. Use this special time to recite the Quran slowly, make sincere dua, and ask Allah for forgiveness, guidance, and whatever you need in this life and the Hereafter."

      "heading": "Tips for Consistency",
      "content": "Start small — even two rak’ahs prayed sincerely are beloved to Allah. Try to go to bed early so you can wake up more easily. Set a realistic time and make an intention before sleeping. Ask Allah to help you wake up and be consistent. The Prophet ﷺ said: 'The most beloved deeds to Allah are those done regularly, even if they are small.' (Sahih Bukhari). Invite family members gently, but do not burden yourself. Gradually build up your habit and enjoy the sweetness of this quiet time with your Lord."

  "conclusion": "Night prayer is a beautiful source of peace, guidance, and answered prayers. It purifies the heart, strengthens your connection with Allah, and prepares you to face each day with renewed faith and trust. May Allah help us taste the sweetness of standing before Him in the depths of the night.",
