      "content": "Sending salawat carries great virtues and rewards. The Prophet ﷺ said that for each salawat we send, Allah sends ten blessings upon us, removes ten sins, and raises us ten ranks in status. It is a means of drawing closer to Allah, softening the heart, and increasing love for the Prophet ﷺ. On the Day of Judgment, those who send abundant salawat will find his intercession and be among the closest to him. It brings peace and light to our lives, both in this world and the Hereafter."
