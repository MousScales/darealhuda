  "title": "Makki vs Madani Surahs",
  "introduction": "The Quran was revealed in two main periods: the Makki period (in Makkah) and the Madani period (in Madinah). Each type of revelation reflects the needs, struggles, and growth of the early Muslim community. Understanding this distinction helps us appreciate the depth of the Quran’s message and apply its teachings wisely.",

      "heading": "Makki Surahs",
      "content": "Makki surahs were revealed before the Hijrah (migration) to Madinah. They focus on strengthening faith in Allah’s Oneness (*Tawhid*), the reality of the Hereafter, the Day of Judgment, and the stories of past nations to warn and inspire. Makki surahs often use powerful, short verses, vivid imagery, and strong emotional appeal to touch hearts and awaken belief. Examples include Surah Al-Fatiha, Al-Ikhlas, and Surah Al-An’am. These surahs remind us that a strong foundation of faith is needed before laws and rules can be built."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Madani Surahs",
      "content": "Madani surahs were revealed after the Hijrah when the Muslims established a community in Madinah. These surahs deal with practical matters like family law, social justice, inheritance, warfare, treaties, and community relations. They guide Muslims on how to live together as a strong, fair, and supportive society. Madani surahs often contain longer verses and detailed instructions. Examples include Surah Al-Baqarah, An-Nisa, and Al-Ma’idah. These surahs show how faith shapes actions and community life."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Why the Distinction Matters",
      "content": "Knowing whether a surah is Makki or Madani helps us understand its historical and social context. This gives deeper meaning when we read the Quran and helps scholars interpret verses correctly. For example, Makki verses about patience and steadfastness were revealed when Muslims faced persecution, while Madani verses about laws and governance came when they had the freedom to build a community. Understanding this helps us apply Quranic teachings wisely today."

  ],
  "conclusion": "Both Makki and Madani surahs guide us toward strong faith, righteous action, and building just communities. Together, they show how the Quran addresses all aspects of life, from the heart’s belief to society’s needs.",
