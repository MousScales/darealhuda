  "title": "Raising Righteous Children",
  "introduction": "Raising children with good character and strong faith is one of the greatest responsibilities and blessings in Islam. Parents are shepherds of their families, entrusted to nurture their children’s hearts, guide them towards Allah, and help them grow into kind, responsible believers. A righteous child is a source of ongoing reward (*sadaqah jariyah*) that continues even after a parent’s death.",

      "heading": "Teaching Faith and Values",
      "content": "Start early by teaching children about Allah, His names, and His mercy. Help them love prayer and understand its importance by praying together as a family. Teach honesty, patience, sharing, and kindness through daily reminders and real-life examples. Allah says: *'O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a Fire…'* (Quran 66:6). The story of Luqman (AS) is a beautiful example — he lovingly advised his son about Tawhid, gratitude, humility, and good behavior (Quran 31:13-19)."

      "heading": "Being a Good Example",
      "content": "Children learn more from what they see than what they hear. Be a living example of good manners, prayer, truthfulness, and patience. If you want your children to be kind, speak kindly at home. If you want them to pray, let them see you pray on time. The Prophet ﷺ was the best example for his family — gentle, patient, and always truthful. Remember, your actions shape your children’s values more than your words alone."

    {
      "heading": "Encouragement and Patience",
      "content": "Children make mistakes and learn step by step. Use kind words and positive encouragement to guide them. Praise good behavior and correct mistakes with wisdom and gentleness. The Prophet ﷺ said: *'There is no gift that a father gives his child more virtuous than good manners.'* (Tirmidhi). Make dua for your children often, asking Allah to keep their hearts firm on faith and to bless them with righteous character and success in this life and the Hereafter."

  "conclusion": "Righteous children are a source of joy in this life and a lasting reward in the next. With sincere effort, good example, and constant dua, parents can build a loving home that nurtures faith, good character, and a strong bond with Allah.",
