      "heading": "Rights and Duties",
      "content": "Islam sets clear rights and responsibilities for both husband and wife to protect fairness and kindness. Husbands are commanded to treat their wives with respect and honor: *'And live with them in kindness…'* (Quran 4:19). Wives should respect their husbands and support them in faith and family life. Both should fulfill each other’s physical, emotional, and financial rights, help each other in worship, and avoid harming or neglecting one another. The Prophet ﷺ said: *'The best of you are the best to their families, and I am the best to my family.'* (Tirmidhi)."
